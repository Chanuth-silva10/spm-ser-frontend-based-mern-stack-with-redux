## Notes

- **M** = MongoDB (We'll use Mongoose to make it easier for Node.js to work with MongoDB, and we'll use MongoDB Atlas = MongoDB database, but cloud).
- **E** = Express (makes it easier to work with Node.js. We'll use `cors` middleware to access other servers outside our server).
- **R** = React (for the frontend. We'll use `bootstrap` for styling, `react-router-dom` for React routes, `react-datepicker` for React Datepicker component, and `axios` to connect to the backend).
- **N** = Node.js (for the server. We'll use `dotenv` to load environment variables from an .env file into `process.env`, and `nodemon` to make the app auto-restart when you edit/save files).
